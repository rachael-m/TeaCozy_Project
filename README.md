The Tea Cozy Project from Codecademy

This is the third project from the Frontend Developer Career Path on Codecademy. I’m open to constructive criticism and suggestions on how to make my code more presentable, tips & tricks, and any other advice you’d like to offer. I ask that you not make any changes to my project, as I am still learning and learn best by doing.


Thanks for stopping by!
